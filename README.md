#  **Description**
  Using [OpenMeteo API] built an weather forecast app (https://open-meteo.com). This app is one of my first apps and i plan on adding many more features like adding more cities, wind data, minimum maximum daily temperatures, and so on. I didn't refactor the code yet so it seems catastrophically bad.

# How to start
  Need to just clone the repository and simulate with an Apple device and Xcode. Or deploy on your phone.
