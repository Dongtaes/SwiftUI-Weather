#  **Description**
  Using [OpenMeteo API](https://open-meteo.com) built an weather forecast app . This app was inspired from Sean Allen's SwiftUI Fundamentals. The app is one of my first apps and i plan on adding many more features like adding more cities, wind data, minimum maximum daily temperatures, and so on. I didn't refactor the code yet so it seems catastrophically bad.

# How to start
  Need to just clone the repository and simulate with an Apple device and Xcode. Or deploy it on your phone.
